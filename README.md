SmartPark is an Android application that simplifies the management of urban parking lots and payment for parking spots. 
The app is designed to make it easy for drivers to find available parking spots and pay for parking directly through the app.

This helps to ensure that parking spots are being used by the correct vehicles and can also assist with parking enforcement.

- **User Statistics**: Drivers can also view statistics about their use of the app, including the number ofparking spots they have used, their total parking time, and their total parking expenses. This helps drivers to better understand their parking habits and expenses.
